The Australian team approached the pitch with their faces brimming with confidence
and not only that, after 2 consecutive series wins
one against Pakistan & the other against India,
now they are in a position to take over the series from the Kiwis as well.


The Aussie captain Ricky Ponting was quite optimistic in the press conference yesterday as well.
